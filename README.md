# Package Overview

This package allows users to perform end-to-end analysis of flow cytometry data. It utilizes FMOs or clear separation between populations to transform the continuous data into binary data. From this point, easy-to-understand plots are created for the data. The modular nature of the pipeline further allows for customization of statistical testing, adoption of alternative initial gating steps, and incorporation of other datasets.
