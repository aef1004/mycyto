Description: Allows users to perform end-to-end analysis of flow cytometry data. It utilizes FMOs 
or clear separation between populations to transform the continuous data into binary data. From 
this point, easy-to-understand plots are created for the data. The modular nature of the 
pipeline further allows for customization of statistical testing, adoption of alternative initial 
gating steps, and incorporation of other datasets. This works was supported by National
